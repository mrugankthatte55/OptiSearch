This project is used to optimize the search query for words on the basis of the probability of their occurrences. We implemented this with the help of Natural Language Toolkit or NLTK and Optimal Binary Search Tree Algorithm. This project is mainly written in Python language and the visual representation of the tree and UI is done with the help of the Tkinter library.
